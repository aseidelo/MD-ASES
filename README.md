Codes for dataset manipulation, training and testing of MD-ASES: Multi-document - Aspect-based Sentiment Extractive Summarizer. 

MD-ASES is a sentiment aware extractive summarization framework for multiple user reviews on topics such as products or businesses, generally found on Sentiment Analysis datasets. This work was developed in C2D lab, a partnership between POLI - USP and Ita√∫-Unibanco. The framework will be published in ENIAC 2020 conference under the title of "A Framework for Multi-document Extractive Summarization of Reviews with Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis".

This repository contains python scripts for every experimental setup described in the paper:
